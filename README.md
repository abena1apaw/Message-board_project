You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/abena1apaw/Message-board_project/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

### Thoughts

This is a beginner django project for myself. It had html, javascripts, css/bootsrap, and jquery. It needs asthetics. It focuses on stocktrading and market analysis.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/abena1apaw/Message-board_project/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
